# Responsive Artwork Generator
Written in Processing, the Responsive Artwork Generator is able to generate the stylized vector image for any ratio or size according to your need of the frame. It comes with a tiling pattern and generative color variation based on your input.

The graphic design is greatly inspired by [Andy Gilmoreâ€™s works](http://crowquills.com/).
